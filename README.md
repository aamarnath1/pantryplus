# 'Pantry +' : Your Local Grocery Expiry and Meal Companion

Arya Amarnath, Ayad Wahed, and Akram Mohamed

## Getting Started

FlutterFlow projects are built to run on the Flutter _stable_ release.

Overview
-------------------

"Pantry + " is a mobile application designed to help users track the expiry dates of their groceries. The app provides a simple and user-friendly interface for adding grocery items, viewing current inventory, and receiving notifications before items expire. The goal is to create a useful tool with AI features to help enhance user experience

Future Work to be Implemented
-------------------
Key Features - Using Flutter + Gemini-API GEMINI API - mainly for google competition, this can be swapped out in the future for better models?

User Authentication:
- Sign in and create new accounts
- Edit profile and meal preferences

Pantry Management:
- Display a list of scanned groceries
- Add new items via a plus button, redirecting to the camera for scanning pictures of item, receipts or item barcodes
- Edit and delete existing items
- Overview of current pantry inventory
- Photo recognition for groceries using Gemini API (maybe other CV model?)
- Gemini-API-based recipe recommendations based on pantry items and meal preferences (this can use gemini-api since easy integration to web)
- Integration with barcode databases for easy item entry (firebase? api call?)

Notifications:
Send alerts before items reach their expiry dates
